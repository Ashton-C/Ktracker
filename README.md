## Ktracker

This app was create to help track bugs and feature requests for a piece of shipping/inventory software used at a previous job of mine.
The branch was closed and I never quite finished it. 
Tehcnically with a couple bits of startup confige, it should work, but I was never able to get a NGINX server to serve it properly. 

Anyways, it was a fun project. I learned alot about backend developement and such.
